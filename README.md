<body><p># Radio Bot</p>

<p>To use this bot you'll have to install all modules.</p>
<p>Do in your terminal npm install --save</p>
<p>You need FFMPEG too</p>


<br />
Then you will have to fill in your config.json file.
<br />Exemple:
<br />`{
<br />    "token": "TOKEN",
<br />    "prefix": "/",
<br />    "botOwner": "YourID",
<br />    "statusChannel": "TextChannelID",
<br />    "voiceChannel": "VoiceChannelID"
<br />}`
<br />
<br />
<br />Then, you will have to create a folder named music, and put your music inside.
